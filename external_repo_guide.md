## Guidance to link to external repositories

You can link to your own repositories to showcase your projects built with AG2. To do so, follow these steps:

1. In general, you should have a clear description of your project and how people could set it up and run it. Take a look and our [project template](./project-template/README.md) if needed.
Please provide a link to this repository [https://github.com/ag2ai/build-with-ag2](https://github.com/ag2ai/build-with-ag2) so that others can explore more projects built with AG2.

    We recommend adding the following section to your README.md file to explain what features you used from AG2 and how you built your project with AG2:

    ```markdown
    ## Build with AG2

    This project is build with [AG2 (Formerly AutoGen)](https://ag2.ai/) and utilizes the following features from the library:
    1. ...

    <!-- Add the features you used from AG2 -->

    Check out more projects built with AG2 at [Build with AG2](https://github.com/ag2ai/build-with-ag2)!
    ```

2. Make a PR to add your project to the README of this repository under `ðŸ”— Links to More Projects Built with AG2` section.

    Please follow this format:

    ```markdown
    - <Your Project Name with links to your repo>: <A one-sentence description of your project>
    ```
We will review your changes and repo and merge them as soon as possible.

Looking forward to seeing your projects! ðŸš€
